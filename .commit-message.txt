feat(phase-1.7): complete maps integration with Mapbox

Implements geolocation and mapping capabilities for business discovery:

Backend (9 files):
- Mapbox SDK integration with connectivity verification
- Geocoding service (forward/reverse) with 30-day Redis caching
- Bounding box validation for location-agnostic deployment
- POST /api/v1/geocode endpoint with rate limiting
- Custom TypeScript declarations for Mapbox SDK

Frontend (10 files):
- BusinessMap component with interactive controls
- Custom SVG markers with accessibility
- Platform-specific deep links (iOS/Android/desktop)
- DirectionsButton component with 44px touch targets
- MapFallback component for graceful degradation
- useUserLocation hook with explicit permission
- BusinessDistance component with Haversine calculation

Shared (2 files):
- Haversine distance calculation (±0.5% accuracy)
- Locale-aware distance formatting (m/km)
- Type-safe coordinate interfaces

Features:
✅ Location-agnostic (all coords from platform.json)
✅ WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (keyboard nav, ARIA, focus rings)
✅ Graceful degradation (static address if API down)
✅ Privacy-first (explicit location permission)
✅ Mobile-first responsive design
✅ Zero TypeScript errors

Dependencies:
- @mapbox/mapbox-sdk@^0.16.2 (backend)
- mapbox-gl@^3.18.1 (frontend)
- react-map-gl@^7.1.9 (frontend)

Phase 1.7: 5/5 tasks complete (100%)
Phase 1 overall: 7/8 subsections complete (87.5%)

One day I will add something of substance here.
